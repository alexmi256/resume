### Objective
___

Results-oriented Automation Developer with a vast experience in the software development cycle. 
Working in multiple agile environments has allowed me to become a flexible and resourceful professional with hands on experience in most stages of development including: requirements gathering, feature planning, feature development, bug fixing, product documentation, and manual and automated testing.

I began with the testing aspects of software but quickly discovered my passion for software automation due to its unique challenges and ability to save time.
I'm always interested in finding new ways to reduce time costing tasks such as manual testing via test automation or by improving workflow efficiency.
For development, I've had the please of working with multiple software stacks and enjoy learning the root cause of issues or customer needs in order to provide the best possible features.
